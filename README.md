# JavaScript-Foundations---Part-2--Class-3--Iliya-Matveyuk

This is a repository of the three class projects that we had to complete on the 22nd of August 2022, in a CodeLabs class.

I will update the projects as I complete them.

As of the 22nd, I am done with excercises 1 and 2 and working on excercise 3.
